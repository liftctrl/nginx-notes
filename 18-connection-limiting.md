# 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ How to protect against slowloris and connection-based attacks?

---

## üß© Problem Description

You want to:

- Protect your server from attacks like Slowloris, which keep connections open indefinitely to exhaust server resources.
- Limit the number of concurrent connections each client can make to your server.
- Ensure that your server remains responsive even under heavy traffic or malicious attacks.

‚úÖ Connection limiting helps defend against attacks that attempt to overwhelm your server by consuming all available connections, such as Slowloris or DDoS-style connection floods.

## üìö Core Nginx Concepts

- `limit_conn_zone` ‚Äì defines the shared memory zone and connection rate limit
- `limit_conn` ‚Äì applies the connection limit to specific locations or server blocks
- `$binary_remote_addr` ‚Äì represents the client‚Äôs IP address in binary format, used for more efficient connection tracking
- `client_body_timeout` and `client_header_timeout` ‚Äì control how long to wait for the client to send request bodies or headers

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step: Limiting Connections by IP

### 1. **Define a Shared Memory Zone for Connections**

In the `http` block of your Nginx configuration (usually in `nginx.conf`):

```nginx
http {
    limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=conn_limit_per_ip:10m;

    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
}
```

üí° Explanation

- conn_limit_per_ip is the name of the shared memory zone
- 10m allocates 10MB of memory for connection tracking, enough for ~160,000 IP addresses
- $binary_remote_addr is used to track connections based on the client's IP

### 2. Apply Connection Limiting in the Server or Location Block

In the server or location block where you want to limit connections:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    # Limit the number of simultaneous connections per IP to 10
    limit_conn conn_limit_per_ip 10;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

üí° Explanation

- limit_conn conn_limit_per_ip 10; ‚Äì This limits each IP address to 10 simultaneous connections. You can adjust this value depending on your traffic requirements.

### 3. Adjust Timeout Settings for Better Defense

To prevent attacks like Slowloris, adjust the connection timeout settings to make sure the server doesn't keep connections open indefinitely:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    # Connection timeout settings
    client_body_timeout 10s;
    client_header_timeout 10s;
    send_timeout 10s;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

üí° Explanation

- client_body_timeout 10s; ‚Äì The server will wait for 10 seconds for the client to send the request body.
- client_header_timeout 10s; ‚Äì The server will wait for 10 seconds for the client to send request headers.
- send_timeout 10s; ‚Äì Controls how long the server will wait to send data to the client.

These settings help limit the impact of Slowloris attacks by reducing the time allowed for a client to keep a connection open without sending data.

## üß™ Test It!

1. Test Connection Limits:

Use ab (Apache Bench) to test the connection limits:

```bash
ab -n 1000 -c 20 https://yourdomain.com/
```

Once the connection limit is reached, you should see 503 Service Unavailable responses, indicating that the server is limiting connections.

2. Test Slowloris Protection:

You can simulate a Slowloris attack using the Slowloris tool. After running the attack, you should see that your server starts rejecting or dropping connections due to the timeouts and connection limits.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues and Considerations

| Issue                            | Solution/Tip                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Over-restricting connections** | Ensure you‚Äôre not setting the connection limit too low, which could block legitimate users.                    |
| **Timeout causing disruptions**  | Carefully balance timeout settings to prevent disconnecting genuine clients while defending against Slowloris. |
| **False positives**              | Test your limits under real traffic conditions before deploying them to ensure they don't block normal users.  |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Limit concurrent connections: Use limit_conn to restrict the number of simultaneous connections per IP address.
- Defend against Slowloris: Use timeouts (client_body_timeout, client_header_timeout, etc.) to prevent attacks that keep connections open.
- Test: Ensure the connection limits and timeouts work as expected under load and simulated attacks.
